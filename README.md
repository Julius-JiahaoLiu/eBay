#### KingOfBots 
This is a Full-stack project bulit with React for front-end, SpringBoot for back-end and MySQL for user registration, login and robot codes storage module. I have rebuilt the front-end with Vue. 

Adapted from the Snake game, this game allows users upload codes as Bots and support matchmaking battles, where users can choose to operate on their own or use Bots against each other.

This program supports real-time battle list and all battle records of login user, both of which support video recording.
